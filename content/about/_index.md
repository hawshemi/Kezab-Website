### Climatic Conditions

The following tables refer to the Meybod station, which is nearest to Kezab. Due to the village's mountainous location, it is colder in winter compared to Meybod.

By analyzing wind direction in Kezab, which blows from the mountains (northeast) towards the village (southwest), we can see that most building openings face northwest and southeast. The mountains sheltered the town, protecting it from the harsh, cold winds.

### Water Sources

#### River

The main reason for the formation of this village was a once-abundant river that provided water to about seven villages. However, the river dried up approximately 50 years ago, and now Kezab relies solely on a spring for drinking water and agriculture. The river was seasonal and prone to flooding in late winter, prompting the construction of an earthen dam, which has since been reinforced with concrete.

#### Qanat

After the seasonal river dried up, the village faced severe water shortages. To address this, Qanats were built at the base of the dried river, allowing access to underground water.

#### Spring

Another key reason for the village's establishment is the presence of a spring in the mountains above the village. This spring, fed by melted winter snow, provides a continuous water supply, supporting drinking and agriculture in nearby villages.

    embedPreview=true

>}}

#### Water Storage Pool

Recently, a water storage pool was built to help alleviate severe water shortages for agriculture in the village. The pool collects water during the winter and is used during other seasons. When the spring water isn't used for agriculture, it's directed into this pool. Its capacity meets the summer agricultural needs of Kezab village.

#### Iron Ore Mine

There is also an iron ore mine near the village.
